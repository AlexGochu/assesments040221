5. 
Initiated fuel state with 0 and after getting data, change the type not a good idea, try to use TypeScript and make states typization

9: links to services should not be presente, must be used another methodology to hide sencitive dade access  

12. 
*related with line 5*, you should receive object but in state have number

13. 
best pratices recomend that console.log() must be used only for developing and doesn't appear in production code 

14-15. 
errors treatmente absent, user will have bad expirience in case of service problems, maybe setAlertSet( for example), if not "processing..." 
will be present forever

18. 
I don't knpw if this line must be presente at all here, if should then logic about fuel state must be changed

18,19: 
absence of linter and autosave code formatting (formatting should pass "else" to new line, on my opinion)

5-12: not bad practice, create custom hook for separation visual and logic implementations

6, 18, 19, 20, 25:
more preferable use some variables or enums in case of using TypeScript, best pratices recoments not user string diractly, and by the way it makes
your code DRYer and cleaner

25. compearing string is not the best idea, reference to the previous comment

25. No bad in this case use inline styles but it will be beter use at least style,  even better user styled-components or emotion-based 
implementation with stylization componentsandone point in favor of exteral file ou libt=rary, /very poor stylization that makes very bad user expiriece
